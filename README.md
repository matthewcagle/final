## Final Project Setup Instructions

In order to run our project, you simply need to download the folder that was turned in to Gradescope. This will include 4 py file named learning, main, display, and testing.
It will also include the 3 dataset files that we use in our project which are then read in. In order to get the datasets to properly load in, the paths may have to be changed
to the path that they exist on your local machine since right now they are using the absolute paths of our personal machines. The places where these datasets are read in as
the cost_of_living_path, the mean_income_path, and the us_background. Besides this small change, all you need to do is run main.py which will install all neccessary libraries as
well as running the three other py files as well. The plots should generate after main is run and will have the names of adjusted_income_plot.png, feature_importance.png,
income_versus_col.png, test accuracy.png and train accuracy.png.
